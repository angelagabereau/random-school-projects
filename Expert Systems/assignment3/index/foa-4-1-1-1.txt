Prototypic retrievals

From the perspective of cognitive psychology, the task facing users who
are asked to produce RELEVANCE FEEDBACK (\RelFbk) can best be
described as one of OBJECT RECOGNITION , in the tradition of
Rosch and others [REF392] [<A
HREF="bibrefs.html#Rosch77">Rosch77] . The object to be recognized
is an internally represented {\em prototypic} document satisfying the
users' INFORMATION NEED. In this case, the prototype corresponds
to the model the subjects maintain of ideally relevant documents. As
users consider an actual, retrieved document's relevance, they evaluate
how well it {\em matches} the prototype. Barry and others have suggested
the many and varied features over which the prototypes can be defined
[Barry94] . Only a small number of
these may be revealed by any one of the users' queries, of course.


Here
we will simply assume the users are capable of grading the { quality} of
this match. Users might be asked to score the quality of relevance match
according to a five-point scale such as that shown in Figure
(figure) . Users can qualify the middle ``Relevant'' response
either by weakening it (``possibly relevant'') or strengthening it
(``critically relevant''). Such distinctions are often made in
experimental settings (e.g., in the use of the STAIRS retrieval system
by lawyers [Blair85] ), and relate to
the varying purposes for FOA different users may have. To make these
concrete, we might imagine ``Critically relevant'' to apply only to
those documents that must be read even for an undergrad term paper,
while ``Possibly relevant'' would be much more broadly applied to those
that a PhD student does as part of their literature review.


For now,
however, we will simplify the types of RelFbk to allow users to
reply with only a single grade of ``Relevant'' ($\oplus$) and a single
grade of ``Not relevant'' ($\ominus$). These two assesments require
overt action on the part of subjects; ``No response'' (\#) is the
default RelFbk assessment for documents not receiving any other
responses. Again, this frees users from the much more cognitively
demanding task of exhaustively assessing each and every retrieved
document. Those documents that ``jump out'' at users as particularly
good, or especially bad, examples of the prototype they seek provide the
most informative \RelFbk. Figure (FOAref) also introduces a
color-code convention: \blue will be used to indicate positive \RelFbk,
and \red to indicate negative cate negative gative \RelFbk.
