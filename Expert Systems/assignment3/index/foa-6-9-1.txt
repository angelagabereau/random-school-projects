Grounding symbols in texts

According to Harnad's grounding hypothesis, if computers are ever to
understand natural language as fully as humans, they must have an
equally vast corpus of experience from which to draw [<A
HREF="bibrefs.html#REF425">REF425] . We propose that the huge
volumes of natural language text managed by hypertext systems provide
exactly the corpus of ``experience'' needed for such understanding. Each
word in every document in a hypertext system constitutes a separate
experiential ``data point'' about what that word \means. The exciting
prospect of using search engines as a basis for natural language
understanding systems is that their understanding of words, and then
concepts built from these words, will reflect the richness of this huge
base of textual ``experience.'' Their are of course differences between
the text-base ``experience'' and first-person, human experience, and
these imply fundamental limits on language understanding derived from
this source.


In this view, the computer's experience of the world is
second-hand, via documents written by people about the world and
subsequently through users' queries of the system. The ``trick'' used is
to learn what words mean by interacting with users who already know what
the words mean, with the documents of the textual corpus forming the
common referential base of experience.


The hypertext itself is in fact
only the first source of information, viz., how authors use and
juxtapose words. The second, ongoing source of experience is the
subsequent interactions with users, a new popualtion of people who use
these same words and then react positively or negatively to the system's
interpretation of those words. Both the original authors and the
browsing users function as the text-based intelligent system's ``eyes''
into the real world and how it looks to humans. That insight is
something no video camera will ever give any robot.
