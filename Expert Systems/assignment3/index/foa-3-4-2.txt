Vector length normalization

One good example involves the length of document and query
vectors. So far, we have placed no constraint on the number of keywords
associated with a document. This means that long documents which,
caeteris paribus, can be expected to give rise to more keyword
indices, can be expected to match (more precisely, have non-zero inner
product with) more queries and be retrieved more often. Somehow (as
discussed in Section &sect;1.4 ) this doesn't
seem fair - the author of a very short document who worked hard to
compress his words into a pithy few paragraphs is less likely to have
his or her document retrieved, relative to some wordy guy who says
everything six times, six different ways!


These possiblities have been
captured by Robertson and Walker in a pair of hypotheses regarding a
document's SCOPE versus its VERBOSITY : document: Some
documents may simply cover more material than others ... (the ``Scope
hypothesis''). An opposite view would have long documents like short
documents but longer: in other words, a long document covers a similar
scope to a short document, but simply use more words (the ``Verbosity
hypothesis''). (p. 235) [<A
HREF="bibrefs.html#Robertson94">Robertson94] .


 Once we have decided
that {\about-ness is conserved} across documents, all documents' vectors
therefore have constant length. If we make the same assumption about the
query vector, then all of the vectors will lie on the surface of a
sphere, as shown in Figure (figure) . Without loss of
generality, we will assume the radius of the sphere is unity.
