Rembember Zipf

Looking at our corpus as a very long string of characters, something
that even a monkey could generate, provides a useful baseline against
which we can evaluate larger constructs.


Associate with each word $w$ its
frequency $F(w)$, the number of times it occurs anywhere in the corpus.
Now imagine that we've sorted the vocabulary according to frequency, so
that the most frequently occurring word will have rank $r=1$, the next
most frequent word will have $r=2$, and so on.


George Kingsley Zipf
(1902-1950) has become famous for noticing that the distribution we find
true of our corpus is in fact very reliably true of any large sample of
natural language we might consider. Zipf [<A
HREF="bibrefs.html#REF323">REF323] observed that the words'
rank-frequency distribution can be fit very closely by the relation:


This
empirical rule is now known as Zipf's Law. But why should this pattern
of word usage, something we can reasonably expect to vary with author or
type of publication, be so universal?! Even more, the notion of ``word''
used in this formula has also varied radically - in tabulations of word
frequencies by Yule and Thorndike, words were stemmed to their root
form; Yule counted only nouns [Yule24]
[Thorndike37] . Dewey [<A
HREF="bibrefs.html#Dewey29">Dewey29] and Thorndike collected
statistics from multiple sources, others were collected from a single
work (for example, James Joyce's {\em Ulysses\/}). The frequency
distribution for a small subset of (non-noise words in) our AIT corpus
is shown in Figure (figure) . Note the nearly linear ,
negatively-sloped relation when frequency is plotted as a function of
rank, and both are plotted on log scales.
