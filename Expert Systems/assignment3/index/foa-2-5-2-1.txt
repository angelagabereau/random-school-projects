Changing indices for dynamic corpora

One reason to keep raw frequency counts in the inverted keyword file
used by our experimental implementation is that this provides maximum
flexibility as we consider various keyword weighting schemes. But there
is another reason that these raw statistics are useful in real
applications, too.


Often it is important to be able to {update} a corpus'
index as documents are added and/or deleted to and from it. Retention of
raw keyword frequency information allows these statistics to be updated
as our corpus changes. Adding a new document simply requires that it be
analyzed (as outlined above), simply incrementing existing counters for
each key word. is used, however, incremental addition of document
postings is slightly more awkward.} Similarly, deletion of documents
from an index exploits the full text of the document itself to identify
all keywords it contains. For each keyword then, posting counts are
simply decremented. {The optimized{\tt fpost} data structure makes this
update awkward as well.}
