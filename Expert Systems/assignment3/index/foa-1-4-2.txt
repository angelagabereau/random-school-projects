Corpora

We have focused on individual documents, but of course the FOA problem
would not interest us except that we are typically faced with a corpus
of {millions} of such documents, and interested in finding only a
handful of interest. The actual number of documents and their cumulative
size will matter a great deal, as some of our IR methods have time or
space complexities that make them viable only within certain parameters.
To pick a simple example, if you are trying to find a newspaper article
(you read it a few days ago) for a friend, exhaustively searching
through all the pages is probably quite effective if you know it was in
today's paper, but not if you need to search through an entire month's
recycling pile! Similarly, a standard utility like the Unix grep command
can be a very practical alternative if the corpus is small and the
queries simple.
