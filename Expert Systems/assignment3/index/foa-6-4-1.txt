A.I. Geneology

The AI Geneology project (AIG) is an attempt to collect information
relating authors in artificial intelligence to one another through
shared advisors. In analogy to geneological family trees, we can treat
the advisor as parent to advisee. Students of students become
grandchildren, etc. A subset of this data is shown in Figure
(FOAref) . As an example, of how this additional information
about authors can be exploited to understand more about the words used
in documents, Steier has analyzed word-pair co-occurrance data as a
means of finding potential index phrases [<A
HREF="bibrefs.html#REF1097">REF1097] . Take, for example, the phrase
{\tt CASE-BASED REASONING}. This phrase has a high degree of phrasal
information content (using mutual information statistics to identify
statistically-dependent word pairs) when these statistics are collcted
across the entire AIT document corpus.

 But a statistically-significant
different distribution is observed within dissertations coming from a
particular set of universities: Yale, Georgia Tech. and the University
of Massachusetts. Within these particular university contexts, the
constituent concepts of { CASE-BASED} and {\tt REASONING} are examined
in detail and independently. Not only do these words occur together as
{\tt CASE-BASED REASONING}, but they often occur separately (e.g. {\tt
CASE-BASED PLANNING, CASE-BASED ARGUMENT, CASE-BASED PROBLEM,
SCHEMA-BASED REASONING, ANALOGICAL REASONING, COMMONSENSE REASONING}).
Within the limited context of these sub-corpora, the keywords occur more
independently and hence are considered less phrase-like. As this phrase
is ``exported'' into the general AI vocabulary, the semantic nuances are
left behind, and the dominant use of the constituent words is as part of
the phrase.


But what is it that makes language use so much different at
Yale, Georgia Tech. and the University of Massachusetts? Perhaps it is
merely coincidence, but our hypothesis is that it is the common lineage
traced to Roger Schank! Work across these geographically distant
research institutions is pulled together by an intellectual tradition
captured by the AIG data.


Part of what is interesting about the AIT
corpus is its demonstration within a single corpus of many of the
representations discussed in this chapter. The AI genealogy captures
some of the intellectual linkage relations arising from the Ph.D.
advisor/advisee relationship. David Waltz' taxonomy of AI provides an
excellent initial thesaurus over keywords [<A
