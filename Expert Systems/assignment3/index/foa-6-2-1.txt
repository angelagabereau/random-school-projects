Footnotes, hyper-footnotes and \emph{cf.

Footnote text embellishes a primary text. They provide a more detailed
treatment of terms or concepts used in the priamry text. A lexical
token, typically smaller in size, creates a correspondence between the
primary text and the annotation on it.


Perhaps the most direct claim of
hypertext authors is that the standard linear presentation of text does
violence to the more networked way in which we naturally conceive of the
concepts being discussed. At the same time, the conventional sequential
flow through text mandated by printed media does a great deal to support
RHETORICAL ARGUMMENT . For this reason, this FOA text was written
first as a traditional book, assumeing a basically linear flow. On this
linear spine, two hypertext extensions have been added (cf. Section <A
HREF="foa-8-2-1.html">&sect;8.2.1 ).


For example, the primary purpose
of last paragraph was to move (the primary, linear course of the
textbook) from a discussion of the syntactic conventions of footnoting
to a consideration of communication's ultimate purposes. Since these
issues are covered in more depth in Section <A
HREF="foa-8-2-1.html">&sect;8.2.1 , a parenthetical cf.
reference to this other section is made. The cf. relation is
bested viewed as an opportunity (offered by the author to a reader) to
compare the two passages. } {cf. for conferre, Latin
for TO COMPARE, BRING TOGETHER, CONTRIBUTE, CONSULT. [<A
HREF="bibrefs.html#MW3">MW3] }


In this FOA text I have also chosen to
distinguish between standard footnotes, and HYPER-FOOTNOTES used
to capture more extended digressions. The last paragraph allows readers
with access to the CDROM version of FOA who arem interested in the Latin
etymology of the cf. token to poke into that. Hyper-footnotes
include a caption, providing more indication (than a simple number) as
to what additional information lies on the other end of the hyper-jump.
