Sliding ratio

The fact that the set is ordered makes it useful to compare two rank
orderings directly. If the ``correct,'' idealized ranking is known (for
example, one corresponding to perfectly decreasing probability of
relevance), then an actual search engine's hitlist ranking can be
compared against this standard. More typically, the rankings of two
retrieval systems are compared to one another.


Given two rankings, we
will prefer the one which ranks relevant documents ahead of irrelevant
ones. If our relevance assesments are binary, with each document simply
marked as relevant or Irrelevant, the normalized recall measure
considered in Section &sect;4.3.6 (or the
expected search length measure to be described in Section <A
HREF="foa-4-3-10-1.html">&sect;4.3.10.1 ) is the best we can do in
distinguishing the two rankings.


But if we assume instead that it is
possible to impose a more refined measure $(d_i)$ than simply \Rel/\IRel
(e.g., recall the richer preference scale of Figure (FOAref) ),
more sophisticated measures are possible. In this case, we prefer a
ranking which ranks $d_i$ ahead of $d_j$ just in case
$\mathname{Rel}(d_i) > \mathname{Rel}(d_j)$. One way to quantify this
preference is to sum the $\mathname{Rel}(d_i)$ for the $\mathname{NRet}$
most highly ranked documents: \beq \sum_{i=1}^{NRet} Rel({d_i}) Ret}
Rel({d_i}) } Rel({d_i}) el({d_i}) {d_i}) i}) \eeq


The ratio of this
measure, computed for each of the two systems' rankings, is called the
SLIDING RATIO score [<A
HREF="bibrefs.html#Pollack68">Pollack68] : \beq
\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{{Rank_1}({d_i})({d_i})\ \preceq {NRet}} {Rel}({d_i})}
{\sum_{i=1}^{{Rank_2}({d_i})\ \preceq {NRet}} {Rel}({d_i})} \eeq As
$NRet$ increases, this ratio comes closer to unity: \beq \lim_{{NRet}\
\rightarrow {NDoc}} \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{{Rank_1}({d_i})\ \leq {NRet}}
{Rel}({d_i})} {\sum_{i=1}^{{Rank_2}({d_i})\ \leq {NRet}} {Rel}({d_i})}
=1 \eeq and so it is most useful for distinguishing between two rankings
when only a small $\mathname{NRet}$ is considered.
