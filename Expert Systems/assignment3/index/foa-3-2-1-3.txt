Herbert Simon's explanation

Simon considered a much different model, focused on the author's
activity constructing a text. Simon's model is based on two assumptions.
First, that new words --- NEOLOGISMS --- introduced by the author
and not previously used, are introduced at some constant probability.
Second, that the probability of a word having occurred exactly $i$ times
is proportional to the total number of occurrences of all words that
have appeared exactly $i$ times. These assumptions allow Simon to use
the basic mathematics of ``pure birth processes'' to account for word
frequency rankings.


Simon was interested in models for the
``associative'' processes underlying authors' cognition ``... sampling
earlier segments of the word sequence'' [p. 434] as they compose. He
acknowledged that authors also use processes of ``imitation: sampling
segments of word sequences from other works of other authors, and, of
course, from sequences he has heard.'' Simon imagined this model as
potentially applying to three different distributions: \item the
distribution of word frequencies in the whole historical sequence of
words that constitute a language; \item the distribution of word
frequencies in a continuous piece of prose; \item the distribution of
word frequencies in a sample of prose assembled from compositive
sources. He seems most engaged by the second of these alternatives,
considering the activity of a particular author. (He uses James Joyce's
{\em Ulysses} as an example.)


Obviously this word-based model provides a
much different explanation of Zipf's Law than Mandelbrot's and Miller's
character-based ones. Simon was familiar with such models, but argues
[Simon55] that his own ``averaging
rather than [Miller's] maximizing assumptions'' are more desirable. But
as Miller notes, ``The assumption of maximization can be replaced by the
assumption of random spacing.'' Worse, in terms of the empirical
bottom-line, Simon's equation does not fit available data as well.
