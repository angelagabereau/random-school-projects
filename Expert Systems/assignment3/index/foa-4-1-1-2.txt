RelFbk is nonmetric

As we move from a cognitive understanding of the users' tasks to
statistical analyses of their behaviors, it is important to understand
one important feature of the RelFbk data stream: RelFbk is
NONMETRIC data. That is, while users find it easy and natural to
critique retrieved documents with \blue{$\oplus$}, \red{$\ominus$} and
\#, they would find it much more difficult to reliably assign
numeric quantities reflecting something like the relative
goodness of each retrieval.


Think for a moment just why this is hard, by
imagining your reactions to a typical retrieval. Is the first document
to be rated 10, or 6743? If you rate the second document as 6, and the
third 2, then you must also ensure that the third document is exactly as
much less relevant than the second as the second is from the first.
Trying to keep all $Rel(d_{i})$ assesments consistent in the metric
sense, for many retrieved documents or any other set, makes people
crazy. Issue a query of your choosing to any Web search engine that will
retrieve 10 or more hits. Using the order of retrieval as an index, go
to odd retrieval documents (i.e., hits \#1, 3, 5, etc.) and
assign to each a score in the range [-10,+10] indicating how relevant
you found it. Now repeat the exercise for the even documents.
Finally, analyze your assessments for each of the triplets of documents:
${1,4,7}, {2,5,8}$ and ${3,6,9}$. How well do they satisfy the required
properties of a metric (cf. Section <A
HREF="foa-5-2-2.html">&sect;5.2.2 )?


 This is not only a property of
relevance assessments. A large literature on psychological assessment
[Kruskal77a] [<A
HREF="bibrefs.html#Kruskal77b">Kruskal77b] [<A
HREF="bibrefs.html#REF611">REF611] has demonstrated that while human
subjects can quite easily and reliably sort objects into ``piles'' where
they like one pile better than another, they find it more difficult to
quantify just how much they like each object, and make these
quantitative assessments consistent with one another in the way that
would be necessary if we were to have a true preference {\em metric}. .
Rather than assuming that users can provide a separate score for each
retrieved document, we will therefore treat this as an ordered,
non-metric scale of increasing PREFERENCE : \beq \red{\ominus}
\prec \# \prec \blue{\oplus} \eeq


Each of these assumptions is a matter
of considerable debate [Wilson73]
[Froehlich94] , and likely to be
the topic of much future work. It is also interesting to note that to
linguists attempting a comprehensive model of how and why humans use
language, ``relevance'' plays a central role (cf. Section <A
HREF="foa-8-2-2.html">&sect;8.2.2 ).
