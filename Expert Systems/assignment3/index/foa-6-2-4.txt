Intra- vs.  inter-document relations

It is interesting to see how similar many conventions for relating
textual passages within a single document resemble those used
to traditionally refer across documents. In part this reflect
circumstantial features of a document's production --- whether it was
printed on newsprint, archival paper, in a journal or a book, or a WWW
page --- will disappear as a common technology underlies them all. And
at the same time integrating new technologies into the publication
process makes it clear how certain features will remain true onlyt
within a single document.


This can be described in terms of a
``membrane'' that functionally defines what we will continue to consider
the document. The defining membrane in this case has to do with a notion
of AUTHORSHIP . The words expressed are the creation/opinion of a
single author or multiple authors, each who have signed their names. For
example, when one paragraph of a legal document refers to another
passage within the same document: Except as provided in the case of
certain unauthorized signatures (\S8-205), lack of genuineness of a
certificated security or an initial transaction statement is a complete
defense ... we can be assured that the document's authors were thinking
about both passages and commit to a particular relation between them.
Inter-documentment citations, on the other hand, reflect a new opinion
about some pre-existing document.
