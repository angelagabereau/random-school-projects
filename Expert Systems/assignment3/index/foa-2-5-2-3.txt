Emphasizing proxy text

The fact that keyword tokens occur in both the proxy text and the main
text of the document gives us the opportunity to treat them differently.
For example, we can {emphasize } the importance of words used in the
proxy over those occurring in the raw text. This would be sensible if we
believed that those occurrences in the subject of a message, for
example, or in the title of a dissertation, are better characterizations
of a document than words picked from the text of the abstract or the
text of the email message. In our code, this emphasis will be controlled
by an integer variable EmphProxy, which notes occurrences
of keywords in the proxy by doubling (EmphProxy=2) or
tripling (EmphProxy=3) the keyword counters for proxy text.
