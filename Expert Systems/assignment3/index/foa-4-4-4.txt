RAVeCompile

RAVeCompile processes the votes which the interactive RAVe
records, creating a relevance assessment file and some statistics about
each query and subject. The first step is to map the four-valued
relevance assessments into the Boolean relevant/non-relevant
discriminations typically used by standard IR evaluation techniques.
RAVe Compile lets the experimenter configure a simple predicate of the
following form: .


where


In one set of experiments [<A
HREF="bibrefs.html#REF1133">REF1133] , the data used two predicates
constructed in this fashion. These are:


 \item[Permissive:] if (two or
more POSSIBLE votes) or (at least one RELEVANT vote);


 if (two or more
RELEVANT votes) or (at least one CRITICAL vote)
