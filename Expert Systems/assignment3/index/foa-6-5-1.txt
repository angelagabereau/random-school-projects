Theorem-proving models for relevance

Imagine the current state of knowledge possessed by a browsing user as a
set of axioms $ Then we can model their information need as a question:
can we infer that a theorem $\tau$ is true or false from our current
knowledge? \Sigma \stackrel{?}{\models} \tau The fact that they have an
information need can be taken as an assumption that there must be
additional knowledge, contained in some documents, which together with
their current knowledge base does allow $\tau$ (or $\neg \tau$) to be
proven. Relevant documents are exactly those which support such an
inference. \mathname{Rel} \equiv \left\{ d \mid \Sigma \cup d \models
\tau \right\} Practically speaking of course, this model is impossible.
It would demand a complete and consistent logical description
of the user's cognitive state. It also requires that the full set of
all possible logical facts contained in each and every
document be similarly encoded. (And then, of course, there is the
minor problem of searching for the minimal set of documents which
satisfy this inference!) of language, for example as documents are
passed around a business organization [<A
HREF="bibrefs.html#Winograd86">Winograd86] .}


Still, this basic
conception of existing knowledge being extended by new facts, and new
inferences being possible when new facts become known, is a very
provocative metaphor at the least. Sperber and Wilson's notion of
connected information corresponds exactly to such new inferences (cf.
Section &sect;8.2.2 ).


van Reisbergen has
talked about this strong notion of relevance as OBJECTIVE
RELEVANCE \vanR{147}. In more recent work, van Reisbergen has
extended this basic model to a full RELEVANCE LOGIC , based on a
four-valued semantics over $2^{\{T,F\}}$ [<A
HREF="bibrefs.html#vanR86">vanR86] .
