Geographical hitlists

SINGULAR tokens are those proper nouns -- people, places, events
-- that have a unique reference in the world. They are distinguised from
GENERAL terms which refer to CATEGORIES of objects in the
world. Distinctions like this have been a part of linguistic analysis
since the beginning [REF54] , and many
with a background in AI will recall Ron Brachman's {\tt
CLYDE\_THE\_ELEPHANT} example [REF336]
[REF669] .


In FOA the distinction
initially arose out of practical considerations. The basic morphological
procesing of folding case, Porter's stemmer and similar tools is
designed primarily to deal with what we could, in the present context,
call GENERAL TERMS only. Conversly, proper names (family and
place names, etc.) rarely observe morphological transformation names.
The capitalization which often flags singular proper nouns is thrown
away, rather than actually helping to ease the task of automatically
identifying and parsing them. Names like {\tt JOHNSON} purportedly began
as names to describe sons of John. Suggest rules like those used in
Porter's stemmer to exploit systematic variations in family names such
as this.


 It is no wonder, then, that NAME-TAGGING techniques
which deal intelligently with singular tokens was an early area of
search engine development [Rau88] [<A
HREF="bibrefs.html#Jacobs87">Jacobs87] . Identifying the sub-class
of people singulars is an especially active area. Relatively
small dictionaries of the ``movers and shakers'' of the modern world --
politicians, captains of industry, artists, etc. -- can provide an
especially informative and commercially valuable set of additional
indexing tokens in applications such as financial news services.


Chris
Needham has proposed an interesting strategy for progressively applying
stronger models of representation based on various classes of singulars
(personal communication). Working on a representation for editors, the
procedure Needham and his group hit upon was to \item first describe
places in the world; \item then people who live (are
born, travel through and then die) in these places; and finally \item
events involving people at locations. Specification of one
layer of terminology provided a concrete frame of reference for the
next: Events involve people, which are associated with places. This
suggests one argument for focusing on place-related singulars first. But
modeling even this ``simplest'' class of propoer names quickly required
even tighter focuse onto PHYSICAL PLACES about which it was quite
easy to give very concrete reference and distinguished from POLITICAL
PLACES whose names and extents can vary dramatically. As editors of
the \EB, these designers were especially aware of how historically and
culturally sensitive resolving political place names could be.


But at
least for physical locations, the emergence of GLOBAL POSITIONING
SYSTEM (GPS) technologies that allow users to know their position
within a single, reconciled geographic frame has helped to drive a
growing market for GEOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS (GIS)
software. and the development of world-wide AUTHORITY LISTS of
place names (e.g., The
U. S. Board on Geographic Names (BGS) and the earlier <A
HREF="http://164.214.2.59/gns/html/FIPS/FIP10-4.html">Federal
Information Processing Standards (FIPS) ``Countries, Dependencies,
Areas Of Special Sovereignty, And Their Principal Administrative
Divisions'' list). Like people's names, place data is an important
information commodity.


Further, human cognition has evolved to live in a
three-dimensional world. We each have deep psychological commitments to
basic features of our physical space and orientation with respect to a
spatial frame of reference [REF47] [<A
HREF="bibrefs.html#Kosslyn80">Kosslyn80] . In contrast to all the
other abstract, disembodied dimensions along which information often
barrages a user's screen, place information is special. Our experience
of time is the other important experiential dimension, as demonstrated
by representations like the TIME LINE . The orientation provided
by such concrete frames can be critical.


Consider, for example, the query
{CIVIL WAR BATTLE} and its conventional retrieval, as shown in Figure
(figure) Instead we should be able to see these retrieved items
in the geographical frame they naturally suggest, as shown in Figure
(figure)


 Note the steps this required: First the textual
hitlist was parsed for geographical tokens. Next, the map coordinates
for each of these WiW entries are collected, and a CONVEX HULL
(bounding polygon) for at least a majority of them is computed. Finally
the map which best contains this region is identified, zoomed and
shifted to best fit them.


Within this same frame, a user also immediately
knows how to DRAW QUERIES , for example restricting search to
only those battles near the East Coast, or along a particular river.
With modern graphical techniques, animation of these battles as a
time-line slider is slid back and forth is almost trivial. But the
additional power of visualization and DIRECT MANIPULATION
interface techiques [REF654] such as
these to browsing users is enormous. The important thing is that this
additional functionality is not at the expense of a much more complex,
complicated interface of commands or even menu items. People already
know what space \means, how to interpret it and how to work within it.
