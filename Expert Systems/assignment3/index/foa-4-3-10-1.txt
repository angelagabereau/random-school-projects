Expected search length

The ordered list of relevance assessments described in Section
(FOAref) also recommends another, holistic evaluation of the
entire retrieval's behavior; this method is known as EXPECTED SEARCH
LENGTH (ESL). ESL considers the length of a ``path'' as users walk
down the ordered hit list, measuring how many irrelevant documents were
seen on this path before each relevant document; ``expected'' refers to
the average length of each path ending in a relevant document. Cooper
initially proposed this model to measure the work a search engine saves,
in comparison to searching the entire collection at random [<A
HREF="bibrefs.html#Cooper68">Cooper68] .


Given that a search engine
retrieves documents in hitlist order, ESL also requires some criterion
by which the users' wandering paths are stopped. discusses a number of
predicates that might be used to terminate the search: some fixed number
of relevant documents, some fraction of all relevant documents, etc.
Since the generality of queries can vary considerably, it is desirable
to terminate the ESL after some {\em fixed} fraction $E$ of relevant
documents have been retrieved.


For this same reason, it makes sense to
normalize ESL with respect to the number of relevant documents we might
expect to retrieve, if we were retrieving simply at random. If we use $$
for the number of retrieved documents (i.e., those satisfying the
predicate mentioned above), we can estimate the expected random search
length $\mathname{RandSL}$ as: \beq \mathname{RandSL} \equiv
{{\mathname{NRet}\cdot(\mathname{NDoc}-\mathname{Rel})}\over{\mathname{Rel}}+1}
\eeq then the EXPECTED SEARCH LENGTH REDUCTION FACTOR :


\mathname{ESL-RF}
\equiv {{\mathname{RandSL}-\mathname{ESL}}\over{\mathname{RandSL}}} \eeq
captures the amount a real search method improves over the random case.
Compute the ESL of a random retrieval using each of the two predicates:
\benum \item $N$ relevant documents; \item $P$ percent of relevant
documents. \eenum Discuss the effect of the measures relative to query
generality.
