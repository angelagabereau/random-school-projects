Keywords

KEYWORDS are linguistic atoms -- typically words, pieces of words
or phrases -- used to characterize the subject or content of a document.
They are pivotal because they must bridge the gap between the users'
characterization of information need (i.e., their queries), and the
characterization of the documents' topical focus against which these
will be matched. We could therefore begin to describe them from either
perspective - how they are used by users, or how they become associated
with documents. We will begin with the former.
