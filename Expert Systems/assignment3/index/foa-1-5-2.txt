Computer-assisted indexing

The field of library science has studied the manual process of
constructing effective indices for a very long time. This standard
becomes a useful comparison against which our best automatic techniques
can be compared, but also how difficult comparison will be. There is
data, for example, that suggests that the capacity of one person (e.g.
the indexer) to {anticipate} the words used by another person (e.g., a
second indexer, or the query of subsequent user) is severely limited [<A
HREF="bibrefs.html#Furnas90">Furnas90] ; we are all quite
idiosyncratic in this regard. The lack of inter-indexer consistency
among humans must make us humble in our expectations for automated
techniques.


But manual and automatic indexing need not be viewed as
competing alternatives. In economic terms, if we had sufficient
resources, we could hire enough highly trained catalogers to carefully
read each and every document in a corpus and index each of them. If we
couldn't afford this very expensive option, we would have to be
satisfied with the best index our automatic system could construct. But
if we have enough to hire one or two human indexers, what tools might we
give them that would make most effective use of their time?


We seek
methods which {leverage} the editorial resource, in the sense that this
manual effort does not grow as the corpus does. How might
editors/libarians guide an automatic indexing process? What information
should this computation provide that would allow intelligent human
readers the assurance of a high quality indexing function? Chapter 7
will discuss ways that editors can TRAIN machine learning
systems, and a number of analyses of interest to editors will be
mentioned as well, especially in Chapter 6.
