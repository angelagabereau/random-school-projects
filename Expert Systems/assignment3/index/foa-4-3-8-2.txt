Point alienation

The sliding ratio measure provides a more discriminating measure but
depends entirely on the availability of metric
$\mathname{Rel}(d_i)$ measures for retrieved documents. As discussed in
Section &sect;4.1.1 , it is much easier to
derive non-metric assessments directly from $\mathname{RelFbk}$ data
given naturally as part of users' browsing: \beq \red{\ominus} \prec \#
\prec \blue{\oplus} \eeq


In an effort to exploit the nonmetric
preferences often provided by human subjects, Guttman [<A
HREF="bibrefs.html#Guttman78">Guttman78] has defined a measure known
as POINT ALIENATION . Bartell has pioneered a variation of it for
use with document rankings rated by $\mathname{RelFbk}$ [<A
HREF="bibrefs.html#REF1093">REF1093] . The basic idea is deceptively
simple: Compare the difference in rank between two differentially
preferred documents to the absolute difference of these ranks:
\beq J \equiv \sum_{d \succ d'}
\frac{Rank(d)-Rank(d')}{|Rank(d)-Rank(d')|} \eeq


If $d$ is really
preferred over $d'$ -- $(d d')$ -- (e.g., if some user has marked $d$ as
\Rel but said nothing about $d'$), we can hope that ${\bf
\mathname{Rank}}(d) < {\bf \mathname{Rank}}(d')$ ()$ {\em increases}
from most- to least-highly ranked document, so that the first element of
the hitlist has ${\bf \mathname{Rank}}=1$.} and so the numerator $({\bf
\mathname{Rank}}(d) - {\bf \mathname{Rank}}(d'))$ will be negative; if,
on the other hand, the two documents are incorrectly ordered by the
ranking, the numerator will be positive. Comparing this arithmetic
difference to its absolute value, and then summing over the rankings for
all pairs of documents $(d, d')$ which are differentially preferred $(d
\succ d')$ gives Equation (FOAref) .
