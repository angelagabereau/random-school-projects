Modes of inference

If deduction is the process of proceeding from a set of rules to the
implications of those rules, and if induction is the process of forming
rules based on patterns across many examples, and abduction the process
of forming hypotheses worthy of asking, FOA can also be viewed as an
inference process: the process of forming questions that illicit
desirable answers.
