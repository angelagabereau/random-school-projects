Interactive RAVe

The interactive portion of RAVe is an HTML document, as shown in Figure
(figure) . The top of RAVe¹s window displays the three queries
against which the subject is to judge each document. Two queries are
short sentences or phrases, in this case REASONING ABOUT
UNCERTAINTY and LEGAL APPLICATIONS and the third is
a scrolling pane containing the text of the long, \RelFbk-defined
document (in this example, the thesis A PLANNING MODEL WITH
PROBLEM ANALSIS \ldots). While the subject is asked to judge the
documents shown to him or her for being about the two short
queries, the task associated with the \RelFbk-doument query is to find
``documents like this.''


Below each query the RAVe window contains four
radio-buttons labeled ``Not (relevant)'', ``Possibly (relevant)'',
``Relevant'', and ``Critically (relevant)''. Since we asked our subjects
to spend two hours each, but could not assume their participation would
necessarily be continuous, there is a ``QUIT'' button which allows the
subject to suspend the session; when the subject launches RAVe again,
the session will be resumed where he or she left off. Finally, the
``Next'' button is pressed after the subject has read and recorded his
or her relevance assessments for a document.
