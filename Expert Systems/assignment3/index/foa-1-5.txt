Indexing

INDEXING is the process by which a vocabulary of keywords is
assigned to all documents of a corpus. Mathematically, an index is a
{\em relation} mapping each document to the set of keywords that it is
on} mapping each document to the set of keywords that it is pping each
document to the set of keywords that it is each document to the set of
keywords that it is document to the set of keywords that it is nt to the
set of keywords that it is the set of keywords that it is t of keywords
that it is eywords that it is s that it is it is \about.


The inverse
mapping captures, for each keyword, the documents it DESCRIBES :


This
assignment might be done manually or automatically. MANUAL
INDEXING means that people, skilled as natural language users and
perhaps also with expertise in the domain of discourse, have read each
document (at least cursorily) and selected appropriate keywords for it.
AUTOMATIC INDEXING refers to algorithmic procedures for
accomplishing this same result. Because the Index relation is the
fundamental connection between the users' expressions of information
need and the documents that can satisfy them, this simply-stated goal,
``Build the Index relation'', is at the core of the IR problem and FOA
generally.
