RAVePlan

A second challenge in the desired density or redundancy of sample
points. That is, for each document that we believe may be relevant to a
query, how many subjects should evaluate it? The answer will vary
depending on such factors as the number of participants, their
expertise, their motivation to produce quality judgments, how long each
will spend rating documents, etc. A higher density means that less
documents will be evaluated, but also that the inter-subject, cumulative
assesment is likely to be more statistically stable. This can be
especially important when RelFbk is to be used to train the system.


The
trade-off between the most important of these factors is captured in the
following formula: x = \frac{N R}{S T Q} where x & = & number of
documents to be evaluated for each query \\ N & = & number of subjects
\\ R & = & expected subject efficiency (votes/user/time) \\ T & = & time
spent by subjects \\ S & = & desired density (votes/document) \\ Q & = &
number of queries to be evaluated \\


 Note that this formula ignores the
overlap between queries that occurs when users see a document that may
be relevant to two or more of the queries in the their list. Care must
be taken, therefore, to minize expected overlap between the topical
areas of the queries. We have also found that the assessment densitities
constructed using this formula to be unfortunately uneven. The main
source of these is variability in $R$, the rate at which subjects are
able to produce relevance assesments.


RAVePLAN takes as
input a list of $Q$ query specifications, a list of $N$ subject logins,
the desired density $S$, and the number of documents $R*T$ that should
be allocated to each subject. The query specifications indicate which
queries can go in which fields, and which queries should not be shown
together. This allows us to limit possible interactions between queries
about similar topics. { Ideally, RAVePLAN could be folded
into the interactive RAVe facility (described below), so that documents
are allocated dynamically and incrementally, maintaining a
nearly-consistent density on all queries. The experimenters could then
push the experiment alternately in the directions of higher density or
larger candidate-document sets. In its current implementation, however,
RAVePLAN requires that we predetermine the list of
documents that each subject will see. }


RAVePLAN outputs two
files. The plan file, which is an input to the RAVe
interactive application, lists each subject id along with the queries
and document numbers which have been selected for that subject. The
assigments is a list of document-query pairs, which tells
us which query we expect the document to be relevant to.
RAVeCompile uses this file after data collection is
completed to generate true and false-positive measures.
